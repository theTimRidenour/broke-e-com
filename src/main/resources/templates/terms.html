<div class="section_full">
    <span class="title1">DISPUTES</span>
    <span><strong>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any BROKE service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by BROKE or through BrokeShirts.com/BrokeShirt.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</strong></span><br />
    <span><strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these terms and conditions as a court would.</strong></span><br />
    <span>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent 4425 Entertainment Company, 227 North 6th Street, Belleville, IL 62220-1129 Attn: Legal Department - Broke Shirts. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. BROKE will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in mutually agreed location in St. Clair County, Illinois.</span><br />
    <span><strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</strong></span>
</div>

<div class="section_full">
    <span class="title1">APPLICABLE LAW</span>
    <span>By using any BROKE service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these terms and conditions and any dispute of any soft that might arise between you and BROKE.</span>
